Below is a conceptual (text-only) overview of how each AeroVista division could have its own unique web space—complete with cyberpunk and futuristic styling, division-specific accents, and at least one interactive element reminiscent of the door-swing mechanic (i.e., something small yet delightful to click or hover on). These descriptions focus on the look, feel, and functionality without providing actual code.

## SkyForge Creative Studios - 3D Reception Area

### SkyForge Createive Studios

**Forging Digital Worlds Through Creativity and Innovation**

_Game development & interactive storytelling_

#### Reception Area Overview

Visitors enter a fully realized 3D reception area of SkyForge Creative Studios HQ. The space features high, industrial-inspired ceilings with exposed digital pipework carrying streams of glowing purple and magenta data. Ambient forge sounds and the occasional clang of digital hammers create an immersive atmosphere. The reception desk appears carved from a futuristic alloy with rune-like circuits etched into its surface.

#### Featured Project Display: Ascension Awaits

Dominating the left wall of the reception area is a large holographic display encased in an ornate digital frame resembling molten metal that has cooled into an artistic pattern. The display showcases "Ascension Awaits" - SkyForge's featured project:

- **Holographic Game Preview:** A 3D diorama of the game world floats within the display, showing key environments and characters in miniature form. The scene subtly animates, with tiny characters moving through the world and environmental effects like falling leaves or rising steam.

- **Interactive Elements:**

    - Visitors can rotate the diorama by swiping/dragging across the display
    - Hovering over specific areas triggers information panels about game features
    - A "+" symbol pulses gently in the corner, which when clicked expands to reveal game screenshots, concept art, and development insights

- **"Try The Game" Portal:** Below the holographic display is a forged digital archway with the words "Demo Experience" inscribed in glowing magenta runes. The area is designed as a placeholder with a "Coming Soon" ethereal smoke effect, but is built to eventually house a playable demo of Ascension Awaits directly within the website.

- **Game Trailer:** A small anvil icon in the lower corner of the display, when struck (clicked), transforms the entire hologram into a cinematic game trailer that plays with rich visuals and immersive sound.

- **Ascension Awaits Branding:** The game's logo appears as if it's been freshly forged—starting as molten digital metal that cools and hardens into the final design. The title uses Orbitron font with custom modifications to match the game's fantasy-meets-cyberpunk aesthetic.

- **Development Timeline:** A subtle, horizontal bar at the bottom of the display shows the project's progress, with completed milestones appearing as forged metal emblems and upcoming features shown as glowing, not-yet-solidified forms.

#### Transition Design

When visitors interact with the Ascension Awaits display, the transition effects simulate the forging process—elements heat up with a purple-magenta glow on hover and transform with metallic clang effects when clicked, reinforcing the central forge metaphor of the studio.

A sound wave "door" that is closed at first. Clicking it "opens" the wave up or changes frequency visually, revealing streaming music or a small audio clip that plays.
Alternatively, a "speaker grill" that rotates around, letting you peek inside at a glowing, pulsing bass core.
Layout: Eye-catching gradient transitions from pink to violet. Possibly a minimal, modern text style, offset by dynamic audio-visual elements.
Unifying Elements Across All Divisions
Consistent Typography: Even if you're using different accent colors, maintain the same base font(s) or headings, so each division is distinctly branded but still feels part of AeroVista.
Shared Glitch / Neon Accents: A subtle glitch transition or neon hover can tie all divisions together in that cyberpunk style.
Clean Layout: Keep core UI elements (nav, footers, spacing) consistent across divisions, ensuring easy navigation and a professional look.

Conclusion
Each division can have its own hero design, color palette, and interactive "door-like" element, reinforcing AeroVista's imaginative, cyberpunk flair. By carefully tailoring each space to the division's personality—while maintaining consistent brand typography and user experience—you create a unified yet vibrant network of web pages that truly showcase each division's identity.
